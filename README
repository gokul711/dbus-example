This sample code illustrates how to get DBUS communication up and running by providing a
minimalistic client server application based on the Gnome Library (Glib). Futhermore the
automatic start of the server by the dbus daemon is implemented.

This source code is based on instructions from RaphaÃ«l Slinckx who wrote the "DBUS
activation tutorial" (http://raphael.slinckx.net/blog/documents/dbus-tutorial). I would
like to thank Mr. Slinckx for providing this very helpful instructions.

A dense introduction about the methodology behind GLib is provided by the
"The Official GNOME 2 Developer's Guide" by Matthias Warkus. A pdf version of this text
can be obtained at http://www.dgsiegel.net/files/tog2dg.pdf.
